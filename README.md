# Netflix-stock-price-prediction

This project implements a stock price prediction model using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network. The model takes historical stock price data as input and predicts the future price.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the historical stock price data of Netflix.

## Requirements

To run the code in this project, you need the following dependencies:

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Keras
- Matplotlib

You can install the required dependencies by running the following command:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Results

The model is trained using the historical stock price data and evaluated on the test data. The predicted stock prices are compared with the actual prices. The evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) are calculated to assess the performance of the model.

The results are visualized using plots that show the actual stock prices, predicted stock prices, and the performance of the model.
